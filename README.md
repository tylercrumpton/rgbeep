An ESP-powered RGB-lit jumbo button using APA102 LEDs.

## Overview
The **RGBeep** is a large, colorful WiFi button made using the parts from an off-the-shelf "tap light".
It was inspired by [todbot's CrashSpace BigButton][todbot] that uses the same components. I loved the design,
but wanted to use APA102 RGB LEDs instead WS2182s, remove the "sacrificial Neopixel", and play with the mechanics a little bit.

On board, there are 16 APA102 SPI-controllable RGB LEDs, four pushbuttons, and a socket for either a Wemos D1 Mini ESP8266 module
or a [Synapse-powered S1 Mini][s1].

The diffuser insert is optional, but helps to hide the pixels underneath the dome. It is meant to be installed between 
the PCB and the dome with the "fins" oriented downwards, torward the PCB. White filament is recommended. 
The model was designed/printed/tested with an FDM printer at .2mm layer height.

## Operation
The **RGBeep**'s D1 Mini or S1 Mini module communicate with the APA102 LEDs via SPI, and the pushbuttons are connected to GPIO pins.
The pin mappings are as follows:

| Description | Module Pin |
|-------------|------------|
| APA102 CLK  | D5         |
| APA102 DATA | D7         |
| Switch SW1  | D1         |
| Switch SW2  | D2         |
| Switch SW3  | D3         |
| Switch SW4  | D4         |
